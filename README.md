# Linux-Game-UI
Barebone UI for a simple number-guessing game, made using C and the Linux OS (Ubuntu). The main point of the program was to emphasize understanding of basic concepts surrounding operating systems and specific functions in C, like fork(), dup(), pipe(), and exec(). The program must be manually terminated before it stops executing, which can usually be done by pressing "ctrl + c" in Linux terminals.
